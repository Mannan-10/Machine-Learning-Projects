# Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The goal is to build models that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, and other specifications.

## Key Features
- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable (car price) and independent variables (features).
- **Lasso Regression**: A regularized version of Linear Regression that adds a penalty to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization by shrinking less important feature coefficients to zero.

## Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Train and evaluate Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models.
- Compare the performance of both models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Car Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). It contains various features such as mileage, age, brand, and other specifications that are essential for predicting car prices.

## Required Packages
The following Python packages are used in this project:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

This project demonstrates the application of regression techniques in predicting car prices, providing insights into feature importance and model optimization.
