# Gold Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting gold prices using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical data and build a predictive model to forecast future gold prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction and visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/gold-price-data).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mannan-10/Machine-Learing-Projects/Gold-Price-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the notebook or script to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizations are provided to compare predicted vs actual prices.
