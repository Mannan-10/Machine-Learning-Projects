# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various physicochemical attributes of wine, the model aims to classify the wine quality on a predefined scale. The dataset used for this project contains detailed measurements of wine samples, including features such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol levels.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification.

## Objective
To build a reliable model that can assist in determining wine quality based on its chemical properties, aiding winemakers and quality control processes.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red and white wine samples.

## Usage
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
